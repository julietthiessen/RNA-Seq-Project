# RNA-Seq-Project

<h3>Goals of the Analysis:</h3>
<p>In the following analysis, we aim to characterize the distinct transcriptomes of populations of the commensal yeast <i>Candida albicans</i> grown in the presence and absence of vitamin B, or thiamine, using genomic analysis. <i>C. albicans</i> is a common cause of urinary tract, genital, mucosal, and blood infections in humans. Understanding how the yeast responds epigenetically to environmental changes via transcriptome modification is critical to evaluating and understanding the specific mechanisms behind potential treatment methods. Here, we will use bioinformatic programs to characterize the specific epigenetic changes associated with a thiamine-rich or thiamine-negative environment through differential expression analysis of the transcriptomes of <i>C. albicans</i> populations. This analysis will allow us to elucidate how transcription or expression of genes associated with the <i>C. albicans</i> response to thiamine changes in the presence of thiamine versus without thiamine, and identity which genes are specifically associated with the <i>C. albicans</i> thiamine response.</p>
